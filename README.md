### Applied working methodology:

    - Developed a backend app and deployed it in one container
    - Developed a frontend app and deployed it in another container
    
### Git Flow Used:
    - Flow with incremental commits
    - Development in development branch
    - Release in master branch (this branch is used by Jenkins for CI)
